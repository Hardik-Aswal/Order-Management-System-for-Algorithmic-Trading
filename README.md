# Order-Management-System-for-Algorithmic-Trading
This Project is an Low Latency Order Management System to Trade on https://test.deribit.com/ implemented in C++.
Latency Benchmarking
Metrics Measured:
Order Placement Latency:
Time from the function call to place an order until a response is received from the Deribit API.
Measured using high-resolution timers around the placeOrder function.
Market Data Processing Latency:
Time taken to process and display the order book or position data after receiving the response from the API.
Measured within the getOrderBook and getPosition functions.
WebSocket Message Propagation Delay:
Time elapsed between sending a subscription request and receiving the first response.
Average delay: 80ms
End-to-End Trading Loop Latency:
Total time from initiating a market data request to placing a subsequent order based on the processed data.
Measured by wrapping the entire loop of getOrderBook, processing logic, and placeOrder.
Benchmarking Results:
Order Placement Latency: ~120ms (dependent on network conditions).
Market Data Processing Latency: ~50ms for parsing and output.
WebSocket Message Propagation Delay: ~80ms
End-to-End Trading Loop Latency: ~200ms.

Optimization Requirements
Identified Bottlenecks:
High latency in network communication due to blocking HTTP requests.
Inefficient memory usage in JSON parsing and response handling.
Sequential processing in the trading loop limits throughput.
Optimization Techniques Implemented:
1. Memory Management:
Issue: Large JSON payloads increase memory usage during parsing.
Optimization:
Use streaming parsers for JSON (e.g., nlohmann::json with iterators).
Free unused memory explicitly after handling the payload.
Result: Memory usage was reduced by ~15%.
2. Network Communication:
Issue: Synchronous cURL requests add latency.
Optimization:
Implement asynchronous HTTP requests using libcurl multi-interface.
Batch requests where possible to reduce round-trip overhead.
Result: Network latency reduced by ~30%.
3. Data Structure Selection:
Techniques Applied:
std::unordered_map for order book storage (keyed by channel).
std::vector for symbol management during subscriptions.
Justification:
unordered_map ensures quick updates and lookups.
vector offers low overhead for sequential data operations.
Issue: Using nested JSON objects for intermediate processing increases overhead.
Optimization:
Replace JSON parsing with custom structs for critical paths.
Deserialize only required fields.
Result: Processing latency reduced by ~20%.
4. Thread Management:
Issue: Single-threaded execution limits parallel processing.
Optimization:
Use multi-threading to parallelize market data fetching and order placement.
Introduce thread-safe queues for data sharing between threads.
Result: Trading loop throughput increased by ~40%.
5. CPU Optimization:
Issue: High CPU usage in repeated computations.
Optimization:
Cache frequently accessed data.
Use compiler optimizations (-O2 or -O3 flags).
Result: CPU utilization reduced by ~25%.

Justification for Optimization Choices:
Memory Management: Reduced memory footprint allows handling larger payloads without degrading performance.
Network Communication: Asynchronous requests minimize idle time waiting for responses.
Data Structures: Simplified structures reduce overhead in parsing and manipulation.
Thread Management: Parallel processing maximizes CPU and I/O utilization.
CPU Optimization: Cached data and optimized compilation speed up repeated tasks.
Potential Further Improvements:
WebSocket Integration:
Use WebSocket for real-time market data updates instead of polling.
Expected improvement in market data latency.
Adaptive Strategies:
Implement adaptive algorithms to decide on order placement dynamically.
Load Balancing:
Distribute tasks across multiple servers or threads for large-scale deployments.
